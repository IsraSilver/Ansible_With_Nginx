# Nginx Configuration with Firewall Rules

This project contains an Ansible playbook to configure the Nginx web server and open ports in the firewall.

## Requirements

To use this playbook, you'll need:

- Ansible installed on your control host.
- A remote host installed and accessible where the configuration will be applied.
- A hosts.txt file specifying the IP address of the remote host.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your control host:

git clone https://github.com/IsraSilver/nginx-ansible.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd nginx-ansible

3. Edit the hosts.txt file and add the IP address of your remote host.

4. Run the playbook with the following command:

ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-become-pass

When prompted, enter the password for privilege escalation (sudo).

5. Ansible will configure Nginx on the remote host and open ports 22, 80, and 443 in the firewall.

## Project Structure

- `hosts.txt`: Ansible inventory file specifying the remote hosts to run the playbook against.
- `README.md`: The project's description file, including usage instructions and project structure.

## Extension and Customization

You can extend this project by adding additional tasks and configurations to the playbook to further customize your Nginx server.

- Add more tasks to install and configure additional Nginx components or plugins.
- Modify the `nginx.conf.j2` file (if needed) to customize a more complex Nginx configuration.
